    <h3>Simple Free Slot Generator</h3>

    <p>This component is an implementation of <code>IFreeSlotQueueFactory</code> that collects all available free slots without complex filtering. It is useful for generating a broad set of times and is typically paired with a more advanced layer (such as GPT) to decide which slots to present to the user. This element can be used in <code>CheckAppointmentTimeElement</code> to retrieve slots.</p>

    <h4>Parameters:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><code>Max Suggestions</code> - How many suggestions to return. Use <code>0</code> if your system does not support free slot listings.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If suggestions are generated, you can use them in the <code>suggestions</code> or <code>single suggestion</code> flows of the <code>CheckAppointmentTimeElement</code> using <code>${status.suggestions}</code>.</p>
